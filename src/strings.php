__('The event monitor uses the API address of the origin of the request to track the actions. The plugin uses two methods to retrieve this: the main method uses the global server variable <em>Remote-Addr</em> available in most modern web servers, and an alternative method uses custom HTTP headers <em>(which are unsafe by default)</em>. You should not worry about this option unless you know what a reverse proxy is. Services like the <a href="https://sucuri.net/website-firewall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sucuri Firewall</a> &mdash; once active &mdash; force the network traffic to pass through them to filter any security threat that may affect the original server. A side effect of this is that the real IP address is no longer available in the global server variable <em>Remote-Addr</em> but in a custom HTTP header with a name provided by the service.', 'sucuri-scanner');
